== General

=== How do I install Repast Simphony?
Please see the current download and installation instructions here: https://repast.github.io/download.html

=== Which version of Repast should I use?
There are two editions of Repast and several ways to write models in each edition 
because there are many different kinds of users, each of whom has unique needs:

* New users are strongly encouraged to begin by using ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
* Users with limited programming backgrounds are strongly encouraged to use 
ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
* Users desiring rapid prototyping are encouraged to use ReLogo within Repast Simphony.
* Users seeking visual model construction are encouraged to use ReLogo and 
Statecharts within Repast Simphony.
* Users with a workable knowledge of a Java-generating language such as Groovy 
and who want to use the features of that language should to use their chosen 
language along with the Java approach within Repast Simphony.
* Users with a workable knowledge of Java who want highly customized models should 
to use the Java approach within Repast Simphony.
* Users with a basic knowledge of C\++ who need models that run on supercomputers 
should use the Logo-style C++ approach within Repast HPC.
* Users with a strong knowledge of C\++ who need highly customized models that 
run on supercomputers should to use the standard C++ approach within Repast HPC. 

=== What is the difference between Repast Simphony and RepastJ?
Repast Simphony is the current version of the Repast ABM toolkit and is actively 
maintained with regular release cycles.  RepastJ is the original version of Repast
that was released in 1999, and is no longer maintained, although archive builds
are available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/repast/files/Repast/.  Users
wishing to develop ABMs should use Repast Simphony, and legacy RepastJ models can
be easily updated to work with Repast Simphony.

=== Is Repast Simphony Free? And how is it licensed?
Repast Simphony is free and open source software licensed under the "New BSD"
license, which means you are free to use, modify, and redistribute Repast and Repast
models.  All third-party libraries used by Repast have been rigorously checked for
license compatibility with the BSD license, and these third party libraries may
also be freely re-distributed.  The current Repast Simphony license is located here:

=== How can I get help with using Repast Simphony?
Support information is available here: https://repast.github.io/support.html

=== How can I create an agent-based model in my domain of interest?
Agent-based models are not necessarily complicated or hard to make, but there is 
no single modeling approach that works for all domains. To get a better 
understanding of agent-based modeling and simulation (ABMS) and ABMS toolkits we 
suggest the following references:
