== Problems

=== My project does not show up on Eclipse's run (launch) button
The project launch configuration has simply become hidden and needs to be manually
added to the list of available programs to run.  Follow these steps:
1. Choose "Organize Favorites" from the bottom of the Run menu
2. Press the "Add" button on the upper left of the resulting "Organize Run Favorites" window.
3. Select all of the items in the "Add Run Favorites" window.

=== WARNING: An illegal reflective access operation has occurred
The following warning message occurs when using Java 9 or later, and has no impact
on the model code, performance, or reliability, and can be safely ignored:

----

=== FATAL: java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError

This can occur when Elipse's compiler compliance level is greater than the current JRE. For exammple, the following
will occur when the compiler compliance is 16 and the JRE is 11.

----
FATAL [AWT-EventQueue-0] 13:46:13,958 repast.simphony.ui.RSUIPlugin - Fatal error starting Repast
java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError: jzombies/Human has been compiled by a more recent version of the Java Runtime (class file version 60.0), 
this version of the Java Runtime only recognizes class file versions up to 55.0
----

This can be fixed by setting the compiler compliance level to our recommended 1.8. In Eclipse, Preferences -> Java -> Compiler and
set the compiler compliance level to 1.8. 

=== FATAL java.lang.ExceptionInInitializerError (caused by java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException)

This will occur when using a JRE > 11. For example,

----

Caused by: java.lang.reflect.InaccessibleObjectException: Unable to make field private final java.util.Comparator java.util.TreeMap.comparator accessible: module java.base does not "opens java.util" to unnamed module @371ef662
    at java.base/java.lang.reflect.AccessibleObject.checkCanSetAccessible(AccessibleObject.java:357)
----

We recommend using Java/JRE 11 which will avoid this issue, but if you must
use a JRE > 11 then these errors can be fixed by using the `--add-opens` VM argument. 
The format is `--add-opens <module>/<package>=ALL-UNNAMED`. For example,
if the error specifies `module java.base does not "opens java.util" to unnamed module @371ef662`,
then the module is `java.base` and the package is `java.util`, and the VM argument is
`--add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED`.

There are likely to be more than one of these arguments required. For example,
the JZombies demo needs:

----
--add-opens java.base/java.lang=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/java.util=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/java.lang.reflect=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.base/java.text=ALL-UNNAMED
--add-opens java.desktop/java.awt.font=ALL-UNNAMED
----

VM arguments for a particular model can be added in that model's run configuration. 
Run -> Run Configurations -> Select the Model, and add the VM arguments in
the VM arguments text panel in the Arguments tab.

=== "Port Already in Use" Error when running Repast Simphony Web Server

When attempting to start the Repast Simphony Web Server to 
run a model in a browser, the network port used by the server may be
already in use, and the following exception will appear. 

Exception in thread "main" java.lang.RuntimeException: Port already in use. Make sure no other process is
using port 5000 and try again.
	at io.javalin.Javalin.start(Javalin.java:158)

The error can be avoided by changing the port number in the launch configuration.
The server port can be 
configured in the server's launch configuration.
+
    a. Go to the `Run Menu` -> `Run Configurations` (at the bottom of the menu)
    b. Click on the Server launcher you want to edit. 
    c. Click on the Arguments tab
    d. Edit the program arguments. The first argument (e.g., 5000) specifies the server
    port, the second the scenario folder of the model to run, and the third argument
    determines whether or not to auto-launch a browser where +true+ means auto-launch.

=== WARNING: NSWindow drag regions should only be invalidated on the Main Thread!
The following warning message occurs when using macOS Mojave, and has no impact
on the model code, performance, or reliability, and can be safely ignored:

=== "Inconsistency detected by ld.so ..." 
There are reported issues with the standard Java 11 install on Ubuntu 18.04 that result in 
this error being generated when a model is initialized. The issue can be avoided by either 
downgrading to Java 8 or by installing the Adopt OpenJDK version of Java 11: 

https://adoptopenjdk.net/installation.html#linux-pkg , 

where the last line would be:

`apt-get install adoptopenjdk-11-hotspot`


=== Eclipse: An out of memory error has occurred.
Eclipse may exceed the specified maximum memory it can use when building large
projects.  The memory allocated to Eclipse is specified in the
https://wiki.eclipse.org/Eclipse.ini[eclipse.ini] file in the /eclipse folder and
can be directly edited with a text editor.   The arguments -Xms and -Xmx may be
updated to allocate more memory, for example

----
-Xms256m
-Xmx2048m
----

will allocate 2GB maximum to Eclipse.  The default values for -Xmx is usually much
smaller.  As of Repast version 2.6, the eclipse.ini included with the Repast installer
omits the -Xms and -Xmx entirely, as the JVM is able to automatically re-allocate
memory up to the system available maximum.  For users who download their own copy
of Eclipse, or for Repast versions prior to 2.6, the -Xms and -Xmx values can be
removed or updated as needed.

=== SEVERE: Retrieval returned no content for \https://worldwind20.arc.nasa.gov/...
This is a benign warning that sometimes occurs in GIS displays because the online
server for layers like satellite imagery is unreachable or offline.  The only impact
of this error is that some GIS display imagery data may be unavailable.  Model behavior
is not affected.

=== WARN "Empty or non-existent path"
When launching a Repast model, the following errors may occur in the console:

----
WARN  ... Warning while parsing classpath: Empty or non-existent path 'mypath'.
WARN  ... While initializing watchers: Empty or non-existent path 'mypath'.
WARN  ....While initializing classpath: Empty or non-existent path 'mypath'.
----
indicating that the model classpath has not been configured, or is empty.  Check
that the *user_path.xml* agents entry points to the correct path for the model agents,
usually by default this is "../bin".  This warning will also occur if no agent
classes are defined within the "mypath" location.

=== When I run my model I see the error "java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: somepackage.someclass at ..."
This is caused by a Java classpath configuration error such that the model cannot
find the specified class "somepackage.someclass".  If the specified class refers to
a user-created model file, please make sure that the *user_path.xml* agents path
is pointing to the project "../bin" folder.  If the specified class is not a user-defined
class, it is probably referenced from a third party library.  Make sure the library
is included in the project /lib folder and that the *user_path.xml* specifies the /lib
folder as a classpath entry.

=== I press the run button but nothing happens or the tick reads -1
The tick counter will not increment if no behaviors have been scheduled.  Schedule
agent behaviors in the agent classes using the @ScheduledMethod annotation.

=== Error "log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (MessageCenter.INTERNAL.repast.simphony.ui.RSUIPlugin)"
An issue sometimes occurs with the Repast message logging system that results in
error messages like
----
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (MessageCenter.INTERNAL.repast.simphony.ui.RSApplication).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
----

with some variability in the (MessageCenter....) part. In almost all cases, this
warning is NOT actually related to logging configuration errors, and more likely
it is related to problems in the user_path.xml file like incorrect paths, or
missing agent class files.

When you start a Repast model and you get the log4j message in the Eclipse console,
you can usually find more information from the Repast runtime error log.
The error log is available when the icon in the lower right corner of the Repast runtime is flashing.

=== Exception in thread "main" java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space
Java has attempted to use more memory that is available to the model.  With version
of Java prior to version 9, it was usually necessary to specify the amount of memory
needed by an application, because the default amount or "heap space" was very small.
Java 9 and later generally have better memory management, however it is still possible
to experience an OutOfMemoryError if a model uses an unusually large amount of memory.

To increase the amount of system memory available to Java, a "VM" argument may be
specified in the <<vmargs_image, Eclipse launch configuration for the model.>>
To increase the available memory (up to the physical system limit) use the -Xmx
argument and provide a numerical value for the memory using the 'M' or 'G' qualifier
to specify megabytes or gigabytes.  For example -Xmx4000M and -Xmx4G both specify
a memory limit of 4 GB.

=== When I run the model I get the runtime error javax.media.opengl.GLException
When running a Repast model with displays an error similar to that shown below is
seen and the displays do not show correctly in the Repast runtime GUI:
----
javax.media.opengl.GLException: WindowsWGLDrawableFactory - Could not initialize shared resources...
ERROR [AWT-EventQueue-0] 12:13:10,314 repast.simphony.visualizationOGL2D.DisplayOGL2D - Error initializing OGL 2D display. JOGL must be installed and computer must support open gl rendering
javax.media.opengl.GLException: Profile GL2 is not available on null, but: [GLProfile[GL2ES2/GL4.hw], GLProfile[GL4/GL4.hw], GLProfile[GL3/GL3.hw], GLProfile[GL4/GL4.hw], GLProfile[GL2GL3/GL4.hw]]
    at javax.media.opengl.GLProfile.get(GLProfile.java:806)
----
This is caused by the system's graphics card drivers being out of date, or the
system graphics hardware not supporting OpenGL.  The most common cause of this error
is out of date graphics drivers.  The graphics drivers should be updated and are
generally available from the computer manufaturer or directly from the GPU support
sites of NVidia or ATI.

=== OSX/macOS vecmath / jogl/ java3d related exceptions
Under OSX, Apple has installed older obsolete versions of the vecmath and
Java3D libraries. These may be located in a variety of locations such as 

/System/Library/Java/Extensions

/Library/Java/Extensions

or

<User Home>/Library/Java/Extensions

Remove all the vecmath, java3d and jogl related jars and vecmath, java3d,
jogl, and jnilib files from those directories.

=== Problems with updating older Repast models
==== I imported a previous workspace into a new version and now I get an error like "java.lang.UnsupportedClassVersionError....unsupported major.minor version 51.0"
Older workspaces that previously worked with Simphony may be setup to use Java 1.6. 
The workspace preferences must be updated to use Java 1.8 or later. Go to the 
Preferences menu then select Java -> Installed JREs and choose a Java JRE 8 or 
later that installed on your system.

==== I tried the batch model launcher in Eclipse and I get class not found errors for the apache CLI classes.

The current version of the batch GUI require a different classpath and
older versions of the .launch file do not have the correct classpath. To
fix this, open the .launch file as text and replace the line:

----
<listEntry value="&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;
standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;&#10;&lt;runtimeClasspathEntry
containerPath=&quot;STAND_ALONE_BATCH_CLASSPATH&quot;
path=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;3&quot;/&gt;&#10;"/>
----

with:

----
<listEntry value="&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;
standalone=&quot;no&quot;?&gt;&#10;&lt;runtimeClasspathEntry
containerPath=&quot;STAND_ALONE_BATCH_LAUNCHER&quot;
path=&quot;3&quot; type=&quot;4&quot;/&gt;&#10;"/>
----

==== When building the model installer I get an exception "[java] com.izforge.izpack.compiler.CompilerException"
Models created with previous version of Repast should have their installer configuration
files updated.  This can be done automatically.  If you created a Repast or ReLogo 
project using a previous version of Repast Simphony and would like to update the 
project files to a newer version of Repast, see the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#update-repast-project[Updating an Existing Repast Project].

==== My Repast project includes JUnit unit tests but the tests won't compile (e.g. the imported packages won't import etc.).
Eclipse included with Repast Simphony changed the name of its JUnit library plugin. 
The project build path needs to be updated to this new JUnit library. To do this, 
right click on the project name in the package explorer then Build Path -> 
Add Libraries. Choose JUnit from the list, then Next, then Finish. That will add 
Eclipse's current JUnit to the project.

==== I imported an existing 2.0 project into 2.1 / 2.2 and created a statechart. The statechart code in my agent won't compile.
By default a 2.0 project is not set up to generate and compile code from
a statechart. To enable this, the project must be upgraded to a new verison of Repast Simphony.
To do that, right click on the project name, then choose Repast Simphony
from the menu and then Update Repast Simphony Nature. Now when you save the
statechart you should see a src-gen directory in into which the statechart
code is generated.

==== Batch run GUI NullPointerException
When running the Repast batch run GUI with a model created with an older version
of Repast, you may see an error like:

----
