== Programming with Repast Simphony

=== Where can I find example models?

A library of example Repast models is included with Repast.  Please see the 
https://repast.github.io/quick_start.html[Repast Quick Start guide] for instructions on using 
the example models.

=== Do I have to use Java or Groovy for my agents?
Repast Simphony accepts both user-defned POJOs (Plain Old Java Objects) as well
as POGOs (Plain Old Groovy Objects) as agents (or for defining other model components),
making the use of Groovy completely optional. For those interested in learning more 
about Groovy, a dynamically typed programming language very well integrated with 
Java, please see the Groovy home page http://groovy-lang.org/ and the very 
informative book "Groovy in Action" by Dierk Koenig. https://www.manning.com/books/groovy-in-action

// ==== How do I change the color, shape, or size of agents in a display?
// .TODO
// *****
// Discuss styles...
// *****

==== How do I create a custom display?
All Simphony displays implement IDisplay. link:CustomDisplay.java[CustomDisplay.java] 
is an example that displays a panel with a simple label in it. Note that most of 
the methods are empty or return null. The important methods are render, update and 
getPanel(). When update is called the display should update its internal state to 
reflect the latest state of whatever its displaying. When render is called, the 
display should draw those updates. getPanel is called during initialization to 
put a panel into a display tab.

The next step then is to load this display during initialization. You do
that with a ModelInitializer. The model initializer is run once just after your scenario is
loaded. It can be used to add additional items to the scenario tree that's displayed on the
left hand side of the Repast runtime GUI. A model initializer then
can add a custom action that initializes a custom display. 
link:TrapInitializer.java[TrapInitializer.java] does just
that. The second added controller action is what sets up the custom display. Lastly, you
need tell Simphony to run your ModelInitializer and you do that in the scenario.xml file
located in your scenario directory (e.g. mousetrap.rs) by adding a model.initializer entry.

For example
----
model.initializer class="repast.simphony.demo.mousetrap.TrapInitializer"

==== Where can I find 3D models to use in displays?
There are many online sources for 3D model files that can be used in Repast 3D 
displays. The models available online generally are of one of the more popular formats such 
as Lightwave, Wavefront OBJ or AutoDesk 3DS. To display one of these models in a 
Repast 3D display, the file needs to be loaded as a 
https://download.java.net/media/java3d/javadoc/1.5.2-latest/com/sun/j3d/loaders/Loader.html[com.sun.j3d.loaders.Scene] 
object. The Scene object is then used to define the TaggedBranchGroup object that 
is provided by the user-defined 3D style class. 

The J3D group provides an interface com.sun.j3d.loaders.Loader which returns the 
Scene object provided the model file. The default J3D Loader implentations handle 
models of type Wavefront OBJ, and Lightwave files. We have additionally included 
a Loader implementation that handles MilkShape (.ms3d) files. 
Milkshape http://www.milkshape3d.com/ a shareware 3D modeling tool 
that has the ability to import and convert many different types of 3D model files. 
Generally, if a 3D model is available online it may be opened with Milkshape 
and saved in the MS3D format.

=== Geographic GIS Modeling
==== Does Repast support geographic projections (GIS)?
Yes.  See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#gis[GIS Projections].

==== How can I import a GIS shapefile or raster into a Repast model?
See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#gis-load-shapefile[Loading Agent Data from Shapefiles].

==== Can I load or create GIS raster layers in Repast model?
See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#gis-raster[Coverage Raster Layers].

==== Can GIS and Network projections be combined?
Yes. See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#gis-network[Network Projections in GIS].

==== What is the difference between the GIS and GIS 3D displays?
The GIS (legacy) displays are the original GIS displays from Repast version 1.0.
These displays provide basic GIS functionality in a 2D projection with limited
styles for polygon, line, and point features.  Current releases of Repast Simphony
still support the original GIS displays.  The GIS 3D displays provide more
advanced GIS display functionality and are based on 
https://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/java/[NASA WorldWind Java].  GIS 3D displays can 
produce shapes for polygon, line, and points, along with raster layers, and online
GIS image data such as background satellite imagery and 
https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=4/38.01/-95.84[OpenStreetMap] layers.  It is 
recommended to use the newer GIS 3D displays for Geography projections since the
displays provide a much higher degree of customization over the legacy 2D diaplays.

=== Running Models
==== How can I run Repast Simphony from another Java application?
Repast may be launched programmatically by directly calling the 
repast.simphony.runtime.RepastMain class. RepastMain takes two arguments, the 
first is the location of the model scenario directory and the second is an 
optional location of the repast runtime location.

Note that you need to have repast.simphony.runtime/bin and the jars in 
repast.simphony.runtime/lib on your classpath since the runtime needs these to start.

Also, you can put the repast runtime folders anywhere you like if you are calling 
the RepastMain from your own code. As long as you have repast.simphony.runtime/bin 
to your classpath, RepastMain will be able to find the runtime and start properly.

Here's a simple class that will do this:

[source,java]
----
public class UserMain {

public UserMain(){};

  public void start(){

    String[] args = new String[]{"C:/myModel/scenario.rs"};

    repast.simphony.runtime.RepastMain.main(args);
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {

    UserMain um = new UserMain();
    um.start();
  }
}
----

==== How can I control the Repast Simphony schedule from another Java application?
To run a simulation purely programmatically with fine control, you need to create 
a class that extends repast.simphony.engine.environment.AbstractRunner and modify 
it to suit your needs. The runner class can then be used to initialize, step, run, 
pause, stop and reset the model. This approach uses components from the GUI which 
is totally user driven and the Batch run which is completely self-contained with 
no user-interaction.

The example Java runner class link:TestRunner_2.java[TestRunner_2.java] and 
main class link:TestMain_2.java[TestMain_2.java] provide examples.  
In this case you won't use either the RepastMain (GUI) or the BatchMain (batch mode), 
but use the runner class directly. Note that you will need to include the classes 
from repast.simphony.runtime and repast.simphony.Batch in your classpath to run.

=== Model Configuration

=== How can I give my Repast model to someone else?
See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#distribute-model[Distributing Your Model].

=== How do I open a Repast model that someone else gave me?
See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#importing-model[Importing a Model].

=== How do I include a third-party library in my model?
Simply place the .jar files in the project /lib folder and the Repast runtime
will automatically load them.  See the Repast Reference manual section 
link:../RepastReference/RepastReference.html#user-path[user_path] for more details.
