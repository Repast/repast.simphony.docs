=== Charts

Repast allows you to create two different kinds of charts: time series and 
histograms.

==== Time Series Charts
To create a time series chart right click on the Charts node in the scenario tree 
and choose *Add Time Series Chart* and the <<runtime_gui_add_ts_chart_1, Time Series
Chart dialog>> will appear. Provide a meaningful *Name* for the chart that will 
appear in the Chart title and in the scenario tree.  Duplicate chart names are 
allowed.

Select the <<runtime_gui_datasets, *Data Set*>> that will serve as the source of 
the chart data. Note that the data set must contain a data source named *tick* 
in order to create a time series. The standard data source *current tick count* 
will provide this. The tick value will be the x-axis value. The next step will be 
different depending on the type (aggregate or non-) of data set you have chosen.

[CAUTION]
Time series charts require that the source data set contain a "tick" source.

[NOTE]
The frequency at which the chart data are updated depends on the 
<<runtime_gui_schedule_dataset, schedule parameters of the data set>>.

When charting <<runtme_gui_aggregate_data, aggregate data>>, each data source in 
the data set can become a series in the chart. The *Chart Data* step specifies 
which of the data sources defined in the chosen data set will be displayed as 
series in the chart. A data source for display in the chart is selected by 
clicking the *check box* in the left most column of the table. Only the selected
data will be shown in the chart, and not all data needs to be selected. The 
*Color* of the displayed series is specified by double clicking on the relevant
 cell in the color column. This will bring up a color selection dialog from which
a color for the series may be chosen. The *Label* column boxes can be edited to 
change the series label as it will appear in the chart legend.

When charting <<runtme_gui_nonaggregate_data, non-aggregate data>>, the series 
definition works differently. A non-aggregate data set generates a row of data 
for each object rather than aggregating the individual data into a single row. 

When creating a time series from non-aggregate data, each series will represent 
an individual agent and the y-value will be the value of some selected property 
or properties of that agent. Consequently, in the <<runtime_gui_add_ts_chart_3, 
data selection step for non-aggregate data>>, a *Series ID* needs to be 
selected that uniquely identifies a particular agent, e.g. the agent's name or
label.  The Series ID corresponds to a data source in the data set.  This can be
a String value like the agent's label, or an integer ID.  Each series line in 
the chart will be colored uniquely and will represent the property of a single 
agent.

In addition to the Series ID, the actual agent property to plot is selected from
the available set of data on the left side list and then click the right point 
arrow to add it to the list of data to display. Data sources can removed from 
the list of those to display by clicking on the right hand side entries and 
clicking on the left pointing arrow.

The final step in the time series wizard is the same regardless of the data set 
type. In this step, the <<runtime_gui_add_ts_chart_4, chart display properties>> 
are specified, such as the chart *Title* and the *X-Axis* and *Y-axis* labels. 
The *Background Color* and *Grid Line Color* of the chart may also be changed by 
clicking their respective buttons. The chart gridlines can be turned on or off 
using the *Show Grid Lines* check box. 

The *X-Axis Range* can be set and specifies how much of the X-Axis is visible in
the chart. For example, a range of 20 means that only the last 20 ticks will be 
visible. A value of *-1* indicates that the entire plot should be displayed. The 
*Show Legend* check box specifies whether the chart legend will be displayed or not.
Click *Finish* to add the time series to the scenario. Don't forget to save the 
scenario after adding new charts.

[TIP]
When creating a time series chart with non-aggregate data and many agents, disabling
the figure legend will improve chart legibility.

==== Histogram Charts
To create a histogram chart right click on the *Charts* node in the scenario tree 
and choose *Add Histogram Chart* and the <<runtime_gui_add_hist_chart_1, Histogram
Chart dialog>> will appear. Provide a meaningful *Name* for the chart that will 
appear in the Chart title and in the scenario tree.  Duplicate chart names are 
allowed.

Select the <<runtime_gui_datasets, *Data Set*>> and the *Data* source that will 
serve as the source of the chart data. Only <<runtme_gui_nonaggregate_data, 
non-aggregate data>> sources are used with histogram charts.  The chart will 
histogram the data recorded by a single data source and then display it. 
For example, suppose a non-aggregate data set is defined with a data source that 
records the amount of energy of each agent in the model. Each time data is 
recorded, that data set will record a number of energy values equal to the current 
number of agents in the model. The histogram chart will histogram these values and 
update the chart to display the histogram in a bar chart.

Click *Next* to move to the <<runtime_gui_add_hist_chart_2, histogram properties
dialog>>.  The *Bin Count* specifies how many histogram bin categories will exist
and is constant when the chart is displaying during the simulation. The value of
the bin count determines the resolution of the histogram chart.  Too many bins 
will generate many columns in the chart resulting in noisy information that is 
difficult to interpret, and too few bins will lump data together and may hide 
important details.

The *Histogram Type* parameter indicates if the histogram is *Dynamic*, meaning 
that the X-Axis range will dynamically change depending on the data values, or if
the histogram is *Static*, meaning that the X-Axis range is fixed. For static 
histograms, the *Maximum* and *Minimum* values need to be provided along
with how values outside that range are handled. The Out of Range options are:

* *Ignore:* out of range values will be ignored
* *Add to Min / Max Bins:* items less than min will count in the minimum value 
bin and items greater than max will count in the maximum value bin
* *Display Values in Chart Subtitle:* a chart subtitle will display overflow and 
underflow counts.

The <<runtime_gui_add_hist_chart_3, final step in the histogram chart wizard>>
specifies chart properties such as the chart *Title* and the *X-Axis* and *Y-axis* labels. 
The *Background Color* and *Grid Line Color* of the chart may also be changed by 
clicking their respective buttons. The chart gridlines can be turned on or off 
using the *Show Grid Lines* check box. Click *Finish* to add the time series to 
the scenario. Don't forget to save the scenario after adding new charts.
