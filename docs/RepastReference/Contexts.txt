== Working With Contexts

=== Finding Contexts
The Repast _ContextUtils_ class provides a number of utility functions for finding
Context instances from the model code.  

TIP: Generally there is no need to store local references to Contexts (say 
within an agent) since the Context in which an agent resides can always be 
referenced.  

To reference the current context of an agent:

[source,java]
----
Context context = ContextUtils.getContext (agent)
----

The context's parent context (if exists) can similarly be found using:

[source,java]
----
Context parentContext = ContextUtils.getParentContext (context)
----

=== Adding and Removing Objects in Contexts
The Repast _Context_ interface extends the standard Java _Collection_ so that 
objects can be added or removed to or from contexts similar to how one would
perform such operations with Java collections such as lists.

* To add an object to a context:
+
[source,java]
----
context.add(object);
----

* To remove an object from a context:
+
[source,java]
----
context.remove(object);
----

* Similarly, to add a context that is a subcontext:
+
[source,java]
----
context.addSubContext(subContext);
----

* To remove a context that is a subcontext:
+
[source,java]
----
context.removeSubContext(subContext);
----

=== Finding Objects in Contexts
==== Finding objects using Repast 2.7 or earlier
Objects (typically agents) contained in a context can be referenced in several 
ways. 

* To get a single random object from a reference:
+
[source,java]
----
Object o = context.getRandomObject();
----

* To get a random iterable collection of some (count) objects of a specific 
class:
+
[source,java]
----
Iterable collection = context.getRandomObjects(MyClass.class, count);
----

* To get a random iterable collection of all objects of a specific class:
+
[source,java]
----
IndexedIterable collection = context.getObjects(MyClass.class);
----

The typical way to access the objects in the returned iterable collections is:

[source,java]
----
for (Object o : collection){
	// do something with o here.
}
----

==== Finding objects using Repast 2.8 or later
Starting with verion 2.8, contexts can provide objects and random objects using 
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html[Java streams] 
which provide higher performance and flexibility in handling agents.  

* To get a stream of all objects of type MyClass:
+
[source,java]
----
Stream<MyClass> s = context.getObjectsAsStream(MyClass.class);
----
* To get a random stream of some (count) objects of type MyClass:
+
[source,java]
----
Stream<MyClass> s = context.getRandomObjectsAsStream(MyClass.class, count);
----

Java Streams provide flexibility in how the stream is processes and added to
collections like lists.  For example, to create a list of objects in a stream:

[source,java]
----
List<MyClass> myList = s.collect(Collectors.toList());
----

To pass each object in the stream to a method myMethod:

[source,java]
----
s.forEach(this::myFunction)
----

=== Querying Objects in Contexts
Starting with verion 2.8, queries on objects within contexts can be performed using
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/stream/package-summary.html[Java streams] 
filters.  A stream filter processes the entire stream of objects returned by the context
and passes only those objects that satisfy the conditions in the filter.  Complex filter
conditions can be used to find objects whose attributes meet a set of conditions.  The use of
stream filters is recommended over the legacy Property queries due to significant improvements
in performance. 

As an example of a stream filter, if an agent has a property "energy" and a getter method 
"getEnergy()"  The following will generate a list of agents whose energy value is less than 4:

[source,java]
----
Stream<MyAgent> s = context.getObjectsAsStream(MyAgent.class);
List<MyAgent> list = s.filter(c -> c.getEnergy() < 4).collect(Collectors.toList());
----

TIP: The use of stream filters is recommended over the legacy Property queries due to 
significant improvements in performance. 


=== Implementing Custom Contexts
User models can implement their own custom Context implementations, either by 
creating a complete _Context_ interface implementation from scratch, or by 
extending the Repast _DefaultContext_ class.  Extending _DefaultContext_ is the 
recommended route since the default implementation contains all of the working 
implementations for the _Context_ interface.  User context imlplementations can
be used in model code in exactly the same way as the default Repast Context.

=== Context Loading
Context loading is the process of populating the root model context with agents,
projections, and sub-contexts and occurs when a model run is initialized, and
may be thought of as the model's "main" function that assembles the model 
components.  The Repast _ContextBuilder_ interface is used for model 
implementations that perform context loading:

[source,java]
----
/**
* Interface for classes that build a Context by adding projections,
* agents and so forth.
*/
  public interface ContextBuilder<T> {
  /**
  * Builds and returns a context. Building a context consists of filling it with
  * agents, adding projects and so forth. The returned context does not necessarily
  * have to be the passed in context.
  *
  * @param context
  * @return the built context.
  */
  Context build(Context<T> context);
}
----

Models should include a single _ContextBuilder_ implementation.  The context 
argument in the +build()+ method is an instance of the Repast DefaultContext 
that can be populated and returned.  A custom user-defined Context 
implementation could be created and returned instead of the default provided 
context.

TIP: All of the Repast Simphony models implemented in Java use a ContextBuilder to 
create the main context and populate it with agents.

The ContxtBuilder is called by the Repast runtime at initialization, but the 
implementing user model class (e.g. MyContextBuilder) is not specified in the 
scenario.xml file until it is set via the runtime menu option.  To specify the
user-defined ContextBuilder, see the section on xref:DataLoaders[Data Loaders].
