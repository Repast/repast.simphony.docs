=== Displays

Creating displays involves the following common steps:

Specifying:

* The display type (2D, 3D, GIS)
* The space projections to include in the display
* The agents that are visible in the display
* How the agents are visually styled
* How networks and value layers are visualy styled (if applicable)
* When the display is updated
* Additional display-specific options

Example displays


==== 2D Displays
To create a 2D Display right click on the *Displays* node in the scenario tree 
and choose *Add Display* and the <<runtime_gui_add_disp_2d_1, DIsplay Details 
dialog>> will appear. Provide a meaningful *Name* for the display that will 
appear in the Display title and in the scenario tree.  Duplicate chart names are 
allowed.

The *Type* list selector is used to specify the type of display.  Select *2D* for 
a 2D display.  The *Projections and Value Layers* section provides a list of available
spatial projections like grid and continuous spaces, along with value layers that
may be added to the display.  Select the desired projections and add them to the 
right hand list using the arrows.  Projections on the right side can be moved back
to the left side and they will not be included.  Note that projections cannot be
added to or removed from a display after the display creation is finalized.

[NOTE]
Projections cannot be added to or removed from a display after the display is created.

Click *Next* and the <<runtime_gui_add_disp_2d_2, Agent Selection>> will appear in
which the agents that appear in the display will be selected.  The left hand list
contains all user-defined classes in the model.  In many cases, only a subset of the
model classes are actually agents, and therefore which types of classes are shown
in the display must be selected.  For example, a model will normally also have a
ContextBuilder class, and additional utility classes that themselves are not agents.
Such non-agent classes should not be included in the display.  Select the desired
agents using the left-right arrows.  In 2D displays, the *layer order* is 
important as agents that are collocated may obscure agent layers depending on their
ordering.  Use the up-down arrows to arrange the layer orders from foreground (top)
to background (bottom).

===== Agent Styles

Click *Next* and the <<runtime_gui_add_disp_2d_3, Agent Style dialog>> will appear
in which the appearance of the agents will be defined.  The *Agents* list in the 
left hand side contains the list of agents that were selected in the previous step.
All of these agents will appear in the display and must have a visual style defined
for each.  The *Agent Class* box displays the model class that corresponds to the 
selected agent in the list for informational purposes only, and is not editable.
The *Style Class* box contains the default style class initially and may be used
to specify a user-defined custom style class for the agent. This list box will 
contain any user-defined style class that implements *StyleOGL2D*.  Any style 
classes that implement this interface and are in the model classpath will be 
available for selection and assignment to agents in the list.

An alternative to defining an agent style class is to use the built-in 
<<runtime_gui_add_disp_2d_4, Style Editor>> by clicking the 
image:figures/edit.png[] icon next to the style class selection list.  The style 
editor provides a simple method to define the agent shape, color, and label using
a wizard-based interface and does not require user-defined style classes.  The 
*Icon Shape and Color* section in the upper left can be used to specify the 2D
shape from a list of available shapes, and the color by clicking on the color
button.  When the shape and color are changed, the *Icon Preview* at right will
be updated.  Additionally, an *Icon File* can be used to provide the agent icon
and genrally is a good way to specify complex agent icons in the display since
any existing image file can be used.  Supported file types include GIF, JPG, PNG,
and BMP.  The use of small resolution (less than 50x50) PNG files is suggested
for best results.

[TIP]
Complex and interesting agent shapes can easily be achieved using predefined 
image files. Use small resolution (less than 50x50) PNG files for best results.

The *Icon Size* section specifies the size of the agent icon in the display.  The
*Value* box allows either a fixed number, or an agent method that returns a number.
When a fixed value is used, the agent icon will be the same size during a model 
run.  Using a method in the value box allows the agent size to change during a 
simulation, depending on the value returned by the method.  For example, an agent's
energy value could be used to increase the size of the icon as the energy increase
over time. When a method value is used, the *Minimum*, *Maximum*, and *Scaling*
values can be used to scale the method value accordingly.  For example, if the desired
agent size is around 15.0, and the returned energy value ranges from 0-300, the 
maximum value specified should be 300, the minimum value should be 0, and the 
scaling should be 15.0  The min and max values will scale the method value between
0 and 1, and the scaling will be multiplied by the 0-1 range. The actual size 
used is defined according to the formula:

----
  icon_size = ((method_size - min) / (max - min) ) * scale
----

The *Icon Label* section specified if and how a text label should appear next to
each agent icon in the display.  The *Value* box may contain either a constant 
String value, or a method that returns a string or numeric type. The *Position*
box specifies the label position relative to the agent icon, with the specified 
*Offset* distance.  The *Precision* box specifies the numerical precision in number
of decimal places to be displayed for numerical labels.  The *Icon Label Font*
section specifies the icon font type, size, style, and color.

The *Variable Icon Color* section can be used to specify how the icon color changes
based on agent attributes. Variable icon coloring only applies to base icon shapes
(circle, square, triangle, etc) and not image-based icons. As with the icon size,
the value, min, max, and scaling can be specified using either a fixed numerical
value or an agent method that returns a number.  When a method value is specified,
the min and max should reflect the expected range of this returned value. Generally,
a scaling value of 1.0 is used because each of the Red, Green, and Blue values is
used to construct an RGB color using a range of 0-1 for each.

===== Network Styles
When a display includes a *Network* projection, the appearance of the network edges
can be specified in much the same way as agents are styled. The 
<<runtime_gui_add_disp_2d_5, Network Edge Style dialog>> will automatically appear
in displays that contain network projections, after the agent style step is complete.
Selecting the network name in the left-hand box will allow the specification of a 
style class for the network edges that implements EdgeStyleOGL2D.

Similar to the 2D agent icon styling, a <<runtime_gui_add_disp_2d_6, Network Style 
Editor>> is available by clicking the image:figures/edit.png[] icon next to the 
style class selection list.  The *Edge Color* can be specified by clicking on the
color button an choosing the desired color.  The line thickness can be specified
by either a constant numerical value, or by a method that returns a value from the
edge.  The *getWeight* method is available by default on RepastEdge implementations,
which are the default edges used in Repast Networks.  User-defined network edge
classes can provide additional methods from which to set the line thickness.

The line thickness and color can also be variable based on a method value and is
defined in exactly the same way as the agent icon variable size and color.

After all styles are defined, clicking the *Next* button to proceed to the  
<<runtime_gui_schedule_disp, Schedule Details dialog>> in which to specify 
the display update frequency and finally save the new display.

==== 3D Displays

==== GIS Displays

[[runtime_gui_schedule_disp]]
===== Scheduling Displays
The last step which is common to all display creation wizards is scheduling the
display update frequency. After all styles are defined, clicking the *Next* button 
displays the <<runtime_gui_schedule_params_disp, Schedule Details dialog>> in which 
to specify the start time, priority, frequency, and interval (assuming a repeating frequency).
These parameters are as follows:

[[runtime_gui_schedule_params_disp]]
.Specifying schedule parameters for a display.
image::figures/runtime_gui_schedule_params_disp.png[]

* *Start Time:* a double precision value that specifies the tick count at which
to begin display updates.

* *Priority:* a value of either *Random*, *First*, or *Last* that determines when the 
display update occurs in a single simulation tick, relative to all other scheduled
simulation behaviors.  Typically this value is *Last* which indicates that all
scheduled agent behaviors will execute in a single time step before the display
is updated.

* *Frequency:* a value of either *Repeat* or *One Time* that determines if the display
update should occur on a regular repeating interval, or just a single time.

* *Interval:* a double precision value that specifies the interval frequency at which
to update the display.

[TIP]
The display frequency can have a significant impact on the simulation speed (except 
in batch runs).  Frequent display updates can slow down the simulation when many
agents are in the display.  Reducing the update interval to even once every 2 ticks can
have a dramatic impact on speed.

Clicking *Finish* will create the display for the current scenario. To actually
save the new display parameters in the scenario, select *File -> Save* in the GUI.   

[TIP]
Don't forget to save the scenario after adding new data displays.

==== Agent Probes
An agent can be *probed* by clicking on its visual representation in a display. 
The agent's parameters will then be displayed in a probe panel. By default, the 
displayed parameters are derived from an agent's Java bean properties which are 
themselves derived from get / set accessor method pairs. For example,

----
public class VizAgent {
	...
	public double getWealth() {
		...
	}
	
	public void setWealth(double val) {
		...
	}
}
----

This creates a *wealth* parameter. The probe panel will display an entry for 
wealth whose value is the result of the *getWealth* call. When the user enters 
a new value in the wealth text field then the setWealth method will passed 
this new value. Read-only parameters can be created by specifying only a 
get-style method. The label for this field will be the simple Java bean 
properties name. Which properties are treated as parameters, and how to display 
them can be further refined by adding an *@Parameter* annotation to either the 
getter or setter of a property method pair. (The information in the annotation 
applies equally to both methods.) Using a Parameter annotation, a more 
descriptive display name can be specified. For example:

----
public class VizAgent {
	...
	@Parameter(usageName="wealth", displayName="Agent Wealth (in Euros)")
	public double getWealth() {
		...
	}
	
	public void setWealth(double val) {
		...
	}
}
----

The usageName should correspond to the Java bean property which is typically the 
method name minus the get/set with the first character lower-cased. The 
displayName specifies the gui label for this parameter in the probe window.

[NOTE]
If any method is annotated with @Parameter, then only @Parameter annotated 
methods will be displayed in the probe panel.

Using the @Parameter annotation, you can also specify the name of a converter to 
convert to and from a displayable String. By specifying a converter, any type of 
object contained by the agent can be displayed as a parameter. This converter is 
identical that described above in the extended parameters section. See the 
convertors and custom parameter types section above for more details. For 
example,

----
public class VizAgent {
	...
	@Parameter(usageName="wealth", displayName="Agent Wealth (in Euros)",
		converter="repast.demo.MoneyConverter")
	public Money getWealth() {
		...
	}

	public void setWealth(Money val) {
		...
	}
}
----

In this case, the agent's wealth is represented by a Money class and a 
MoneyConverter is used to convert to and from a String value. Lastly, by default 
the probe's title will be the result of calling *toString()* on the probed 
object  A more appropriate title can be specified either by overriding toString() 
and returning the desired value, or annotating any method that returns the desired 
title with @ProbeID. For example:

----
public class VizAgent {
	... 
	@ProbeID 
	public String name() { return name;}

	@Parameter(usageName="wealth", displayName="Agent Wealth (in Euros)",
		converter="repast.demo.MoneyConverter")
	public Money getWealth() {
		...
	}

	public void setWealth(Money val) {
		...
	}
}
----
