== Introduction
Repast Simphony is a agent-based modeling toolkit and cross platform 
Java-based modeling system that runs under Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, 
and Linux. Repast supports the development of extremely flexible models of 
interacting agents for use on workstations and computing clusters. Repast 
Simphony models can be developed in several different forms including the ReLogo 
dialect of Logo, point-and-click statecharts, Groovy, or Java, all of which can 
be fluidly interleaved.

This "cookbook style" reference manual provides background and code examples for
many aspects of the Repast Simphony API but does not show how to build a 
complete working model from scratch. It is recommended that new users first
review the introductory tutorial documents included with the Repast installer 
and available at the online https://repast.github.io/docs.html[Repast documentation page].
