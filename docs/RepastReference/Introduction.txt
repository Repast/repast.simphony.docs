Introduction
------------

Repast Simphony is a tightly integrated, richly interactive, cross platform 
Java-based modeling system that runs under Microsoft Windows, Apple macOS, 
and Linux. Repast supports the development of extremely flexible models of 
interacting agents for use on workstations and computing clusters. Repast 
Simphony models can be developed in several different forms including the ReLogo 
dialect of Logo, point-and-click statecharts, Groovy, or Java, all of which can 
be fluidly interleaved.

This "cookbook style" reference manual provides background and code examples for
many aspects of the Repast Simphony API but does not show how to build a 
complete working model from scratch. It is recommended that new users first
review the introductory tutorial documents included with the Repast installer 
and available at the Repast online documentation page: 
https://repast.github.io/docs.html

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Current software releases are available from 
https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony/releases/. 

.Microsoft Windows
https://www.java.com[Java] must be installed prior to running Repast Simphony.  
We reccommend using both the 64-bit version of Java and Repast, which is 
available as a 32-bit or 64-bit installer for Windows.  If you have 32-bit Java
installed you must use the 32-bit Repast installer, and likewise if you have the
64-bit version of Java installed, you must use the 64-bit Repast installer.

.macOS
macOS users should download the macOS Disk Image, double click on the 
resulting file and follow the installation instructions that appear. You may 
need to alter your Security & Privacy settings in System Preferences to allow 
you to open Repast Simphony. Alternatively, right clicking on the Repast 
Simphony application and selecting Open will allow you to authenticate and open 
it. 

.Linux
Linux users and Unix-related system users should download 
http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-eclipse-committers/oxygen1[
Eclipse IDE for Eclipse Committers Oxygen] then use the Eclipse Update Manager 
(under Help -> Install New Software) to install Repast from its update site: 
https://repocafe.cels.anl.gov/repos/repast/. Repast when installed via the 
update site has the following additional requirement that can be installed using 
Eclipse's Update Manager.

From the Groovy Update Site (http://dist.springsource.org/snapshot/GRECLIPSE/e4.7/):

* Extra Groovy Compilers
* Groovy-Eclipse
* Uncategorized

Once you have downloaded eclipse and installed the plugins, the groovy compiler 
version must be set to anything in the 2.0. version line. Anything else will 
prevent Repast Simphony and especially ReLogo from working correctly. You can 
set the groovy compiler preferences in either the workspace or project 
preferences pane via the "Groovy Compiler" page.

The demonstration models are not provided via the update site, but they can be 
downloaded from the GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/Repast/repast.simphony.models/. Once downloaded, start 
Eclipse and switch to your chosen workspace. Right click in the package panel, 
and choose import, General, Archive File and follow the wizard from there.
