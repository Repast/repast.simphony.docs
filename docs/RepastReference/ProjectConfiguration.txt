== Project Setup and Configuration
To begin the development of a Repast Simphony model in Java, ReLogo, Groovy, or 
Statecharts, a new project needs to be created, or an existing Java or Groovy project
can be configured to use Repast capabilities. 

Creating new Repast Simphony projects follows the standard Eclipse IDE new project
creation wizard, but with customized options for Repast projects.  Step-by-step
instructions for creating new Repast projects are provided below.  Please also
refer to the online https://help.eclipse.org[Eclipse Help pages] for more details. 

[[create-repast-project]]
=== Creating a New Repast Project
1. *Start Repast Simphony and open a new workspace*.  A blank workspace is set to the
ReLogo perspective as shown below.  Eclipse perspectives provide customized layouts
of the Eclipse window components depending on the type of activity the user is doing.
The ReLogo perspective provides a minimal view of development components.  For developing
Java-based Repast projects, switch to the Java perspective by clicking the Java
perspective button image:figures/eclipse_java_button.png[] in the upper right corner.

4. *The Repast Simphony Project dialog appears* and prompts for a project name.  Provide
the project name and optionally specify the project location.  By default, the project
will be saved in the workspace folder.  Click Finish to complete the new project
setup.

=== Creating a New ReLogo Project
ReLogo project creation is nearly identical to <<create-repast-project, creating
a Repast project>>.  The steps are outlined below.
  
1. *Start Repast Simphony and open a new workspace*.  A blank workspace is set to the
ReLogo perspective as shown below.  Eclipse perspectives provide customized layouts
of the Eclipse window components depending on the type of activity the user is doing.
The ReLogo perspective provides a minimal view of development components.  Different
Eclipse perspectives can be switched to, however it is recommended to continue
using the ReLogo perspective with ReLogo projects.

=== Adding Repast to an Existing Project
An existing Java project can be configured such that Repast and ReLogo models
and components can be used.  This involves adding the *Repast Nature* to the Eclipse
project.  Adding the Repast Nature requires a single step:

1. *Right click on the project and select Repast Simphony -> Add 
Repast Simphony Nature*. This will add the Repast libraries to the 
project class path so that you can reference Repast classes and run simulations 
from your project without needing to manually add all of the Repast libraries 
and dependencies.

2. After the Repast Nature has been added, the existing project will be modified
to include the Groovy and Repast development libraries as shown in the following 
figure.   Note that the Repast configuration files have not been added to the 
project, as the Repast Nature only provides access to the libraries.  To fully
build a Repast model with the updated Java project, the <<project-contents, project
configuration files>> will need to be manually added.

[[project-contents]]
=== Project Contents and Model Configuration Files
Repast and ReLogo projects contain a number of folders and files that are required
and contain essential model configuration data.  Repast Java project developers
typically modify these files to suit the model properties, however ReLogo project
developers typically will not need to modify any of these files.  The following
figure displays the project contents for a newly created Repast Java project.  If
the project contents are not visible, it may be necessary to switch to the Java 
perspective by clicking the Java perspective button image:figures/eclipse_java_button.png[] 
in the upper right corner.

[[repast_project_contents]]
.Workspace Showing the full contents of aRepast Java Project
image::figures/repast_project_contents.png[width=750]

.Required Project Contents
The following list of folders contain essential Repast project configuration files
and should not be deleted or renamed:

* *src* is the source code folder that contains all of the project source code 
such as agent class files.

* *batch* folder contains batch run parameter XML file that is normally used
when running Repast models in batch mode. 

* *installer* folder contains configuration files used by the Repast model builder
installer that packages stand-alone distributable versions of the user's Repast model.

* *launchers* folder contains the Eclipse launch configuration files that are used
to run the Repast model.

* *MyProject.rs* folder contains the Repast model meta-data XML files that describe
specific details about the Repast model, like agent locations, types of displays,
charts, and logging information.  The prefix of this folder (before .rs) is depndend
on the project name.

After creating a new Repast project, the model meta-data XML files need to be updated
according to the types of components that a user would like to include in the model.
The only two files that need to be directly edited are the <<user-path, user_path.xml>>
and the <<context-xml, context.xml>> files.  All other project configuration files
are automatically updated by the Repast GUI, although they may be manually edited
as well.

[[user-path]]
==== user_path.xml
The user_path.xml file located in the MyProject.rs folder provides information to
the Repast runtime about where to look for agent files and other files or libraries
needed by the model.  The default user_path.xml file created by the Repast new
project wizard is shown below.  In many cases, the default user_path.xml file
does not need to be changed at all since the default configuration is the least
constrained in terms of what agents and libraries are made available to the Repast
runtime. 

----
<model name="MyProject" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="http://repast.org/scenario/user_path">
  <classpath>
    <agents path="../bin" />
    <entry path="../lib" />
  </classpath>
</model>

----

NOTE: The only unique entry in the user_path.xml file is the model name attribute
which is the same as the project name.

As may be evident, the purpose of the user_path.xml file is to provide the locations
of the model agent classes to the Repast runtime.  The default user_path.xml sets
the *agents path* value to "../bin" which is the default location of compiled class
files in Java projects.  The bin folder is typically not visible in the Java perspective.
When the agents path is set to "../bin", it means that the Repast runtime will look
in the project bin folder which is the root folder for all compiled classes in the 
project.  In other words, *all* class files in the project will be made available 
to the Repast runtime as "Agents".  This special classification is used in the runtime
to scan agent classes for annotations, such as those used for scheduling, and all
agent classes will appear in the runtime wizards for creating displays or data 
collectors.  

For small projects, providing the entire set of project classes to the Repast 
agents path may be fine, however when projects become very large, it may be beneficial
to *filter* what types of classes the Repast runtime considers "agents".  The filter
can be specified in the agents path element as follows:

----
<agents path="../bin" filter="myProject.somepackage.agents.*"/>
----

The filter value specifies which package contents are to be loaded as "agents"
by the Repast runtime.  In the above example, it is assumed that the package 
myProject.somepackage.agents exists, and that the agent classes are located in this
package.  Note that the wildcard character "*" is required to specify that all classes
in the package should be loaded as agents.

----
<model name="Model Name">
  <classpath>
    <entry path="..." annotations="[true|false]" />
    <agents path="..." filter="..." />
    <builtin fullname="..." />
  </classpath>
</model>
----

* *path* is path statement to a directory or jar file. If the directory contains 
jars then all those jars are added to the classpath. If the directory or its 
children contain .class files then the directory is added to the classpath. More 
than one path can be specified. Multiple paths should be "," separated. For .class 
files, the path functions as a classpath and so it must be the directory 
immediately above the directories corresponding to the class packages. For 
example, given the class repast.simphony.MyClass and the directory structure 
X/bin/repast/simphony/MyClass.class, the path should be X/bin. This applies to 
path in both entry and agents elements.

* *annotations* specified whether or not any classes found in the specified 
path(s) should be processed for annotations. The default is false.

* *agents* specifies the path where agent classes can be found. These are 
automatically processed for annotations.

* *filter* specifies a class filter on the agents path(s). For example a filter 
of "anl.gov.Agent" will filter out all classes but anl.gov.Agent as agent 
classes. Filters can contain the wildcard "*". So for example, "anl.gov.*Agent" 
will include any class in the package anl.gov whose class name ends with Agent.

* *builtin* is for cases when a user needs to add an agent class 
existing in one of the repast plugins. The user specifies the canonical class 
name as the fullname.

NOTE: For the builtins, since the class can be in any one of the repast plugins, 
without hard coding the path, it is difficult to use the filter mechanism on all 
the plugins. This means that unless we can figure out a way to figure out the 
path of a resource containing a package, we must specify each individual class 
that we'd like to be considered an agent class. The good news is that this is 
not a common usage.

    <attribute id="border rule" type="string" value="periodic" />
    <attribute id="allows multi" type="boolean" value="true"/>
  </projection>
</context>
----

will create a 200 x 100 grid with an id of "MyGrid". The border rule for the grid 
is "periodic" so the grid will wrap, forming a torus. The grid will also allow 
multiple agents in each cell.

  </projection>
</context>
-----

will create a 200 x 100 continuous space with an id of "MySpace". The border rule

of this type. |Any properly formatted class name extending RepastEdge |string |NO
|====

For example:
----
<context id="MyContext">
  <projection id="MyNetwork" type="network">
    <attribute id="directed" type="boolean" value="true"/>
  </projection>
</context>
----

will create a network with an id of "MyNetwork". The network will be directed 
and use the default RepastEdge as the edge type.

=== Distributing Your Model

// TODO Needs updating


Models created with Repast Simphony may easily be distributed with the provided 
Install Builder tool. This tool builds a distributable installer that anyone may 
use to install the model to their computer. The only requirement for those to 
who the model is distributed is the target system to have a current Java Runtime 
Environment.

To start the Install Builder, select Build Installer in the run menu

The builder make take a few minutes to complete the installer. Once this process 
is complete, a message "BUILD SUCCESSFUL" should be visible in the Console 
window.
