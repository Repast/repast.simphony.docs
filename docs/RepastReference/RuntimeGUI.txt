=== Scneario Tree
The <<runtime_gui_scenario_tree, scenario tree>> in the Repast runtime GUI provides access to wizards and menus
for creating and modifying runtime components like charts, displays, and data
logging.  The Repast runtime components reflect the state of the model simulation
in various ways, like displaying the positions of the agents in space.  The Repast
runtime components do not actually have an effect on model behavior, except for when
the parameters or custome user panel components are adjusted.  In other words, 
creating a chart or a display, or an absence of these components will not affect 
model behavior.

The scenario tree contains a fixed set of available runtime components including
time series and histogram charts, data loaders, data sets, displays (2D, 3D, GIS),
file (data) sinks, and User Panel options.  Right clicking on any of the top-level
component categories provides the option to create new entries for each.  Double
cliking on existing entries in each category will provide access to specific options.

The scenario tree is just one of the available runtime interfaces available in the
left panel of the runtime window.  Additional panels can be accessed by clicking on
the named tabs in the left side panel for Run Options, Parameters, and User Panel.

=== Run Options
The <<runtime_gui_run_options, runtime run options panel>> provides access to options for controlling the 
model run state.  These include:

* Pause At: a double precision value that indicates the tick at which to automatically
pause the model.  Default value of zero disables this option.

* Stop At: a double precision value that indicates the tick at which to automatically
stop the model.  Default value of zero disables this option.

* Schedule Tick Delay: The value of the slider indicates the time in milliseconds
for which to delay the model between scheduled ticks. Default value of zero 
disables this option.

[TIP]
Increasing the shedule tick delay will slow down the model execution speed and can
be useful when observing agent behaviors that execute too quickly.
